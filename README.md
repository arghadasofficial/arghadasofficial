## 🎯 Development Philosophy

> *"Code is like humor. If you have to explain it, it’s bad."* — **Cory House**  

✔️ **Performance over fluff** – Code should run fast, not just look good.  
✔️ **Minimalism in complexity** – Simplify logic, avoid unnecessary dependencies.  
✔️ **User-first design** – Whether it’s UI or backend, the user experience matters.
